# Computing, Data Processing, and AI Development

## AI/ML Platform

A cloud-hosted or containerized services/models that allow development teams and business users to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) models via APIs, software development kits (SDKs), or applications without requiring deep data science expertise. These hosted models deliver services with capabilities in language, vision and automated machine learning (ML).
